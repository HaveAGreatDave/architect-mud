// PURE. No DB handle, no fs, no clock, no RNG, no environment reads. Everything
// here is a function of parsed content and nothing else, so the same input always
// produces the same output on every machine and in CI. That is not a style
// preference: the whole point of moving presentation to build time is that a
// derived value cannot vary by database, and the enforcement is that a `query()`
// written into this file has nothing to call.
//
// Today this file holds one function. `resolveDefault` is the primitive every
// later derivation calls (§7.3 "Build this first"), so it ships alone, ahead of
// `deriveWorld`, `zone_render` and the palette (§11 step 1).

// ── The bottom rung ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// What a key means when nobody — tile, region or palette — has said anything.
// A key absent from this table resolves to null, which is the honest answer for
// anything optional; a key present here is one where "nothing" is not a legal
// value and the engine would otherwise have to invent one at the point of use.

/**
 * The defaults-and-overrides primitive (spec §1.3).
 *
 *   tile override  →  region `defaults`  →  palette (by terrain)  →  global
 *
 * Most-specific wins, so a region default deliberately SHADOWS the palette: a
 * region saying "this place sounds like neon rain" outranks a terrain saying
 * "wasteland is quiet". Refining below a region means refining the region.
 *
 * Note the one thing this cannot express: with a nullable column there is no
 * way for a tile to say "explicitly nothing, do not inherit" — absent and none
 * are the same bytes. Every rung therefore treats null/undefined as "no opinion".
 * If a tile ever needs to opt out of its region, that is a new sentinel and a
 * deliberate decision, not something to bolt on at a call site.
 *
 * @param {string} key      column name (audio_theme_id, ambient_theme, color, …)
 * @param {object} zone     the tile row / parsed content file
 * @param {object} [region] the zone's region row (regions.defaults holds the slot)
 * @param {object} [palette] parsed content/map/terrain.json — absent until §11 step 3
